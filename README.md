# Data-Science-Assignment-1


## Description:

In this assignment, the goal was to implement linear regression on the given dataset of houses to predict the house price. 
It was implemented with two different techniques 
  1. Using one Variable
  2. Using Multiple variable
  
With multiple variables the pre processing will be done using by feature normalization.

## Training Data Visualization
Data can be visualized using following equations.

## Updating Weights
The cost function to update the weights was calculated using the following equation.

## Learning Rate Curve

The relation between learning rate and number of iterations can be seen in the following graph

## Code
There are two different files for each of the two questions and description of each question requirements are give in the document.

The process was completed in the following order.

  1. Reading Data from File
  2. Initializing Values
  3. Running Iterations
  4. Initializing Values for Plot
  5. Plotting Scatter Graph
  

## How to Run
To run the code you need to install Jupter Note Book with Python 3.6. You can directly clone the respository and open each question in separate note book.

If there is any question feel free to reach me via e-mail. Thanks
